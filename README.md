# Human-Development-Index-Tableau-Project
This Tableau visualization utilized the Human Development Index (HDI) developed by the United Nations (UN) to provide information on a country's development. The HDI  measures the country's overall achievement in its socioeconomic dimensions. These socioeconomics dimensions are based on a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable and have a decent standard of living. In this visualization, we used the HDI dataset along with the Gender Develop Index (GDI), Life Expectancy, and Democracy Index datasets to assess different factors that drive the socioeconomic dimensions of the HDI. 

The HDI, GDI, and Life Expectancy data can be found at Uniited Nations Human Development Data Center: https://hdr.undp.org/en/data The Democracy Index data is available at Gapminder: https://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/democracy-index/. The information about the classification of countries by GNI Per Captipa is available at the World Bank database: https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups. 

The current analysis further conducted Linear regression analysis on the impacts of socioeconomic factors that impact the Human Development Index to measure the statistical significance of the key factors that drive HDI. In addition, Logistic and Random Forest Regression analyses are comnducted to examine the accuracies of these models in predicting the human development levels of individual countries.
